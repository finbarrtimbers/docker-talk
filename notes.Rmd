- Work for DHA
- statistical consulting firm
- many work is similar:
  - If we're looking at the distribution of values, probably going to use a
    histogram
  - If we're looking at the change in a variable over time, probably going to
    use a line chart
  - etc., etc.
- DHA values design heavily- UX & design are some of our competitive advantages
- Have a series of "best practice" charts that we copy, mostly inspired by
  Tufte (Visual Display of Quantitative Information is required reading):
  - insert histogram graph
  - insert highlighted line chart
- Two problems:
  - How do we copy them? (No documentation!)
  - Takes time to do when really, all we need ot do is change the data source
- Solution:
  - R! (and ggplot)
- Then! We can regenerate graphs by changing a line of code
- [picture of code]
- What we did:
  - use RMarkdown to write slides showing the code
  - work with designer to get the canonical slides
  - put the code in git (Bitbucket) and let the company clone them
  - Easy to transfer
  - Automated dev environments (first scripts, then Docker)
  - With Automated dev environments, low barrier to entry
  - With Git, easy to iterate
- 3 Lessons:
  1. Make it good: It's hard to make people
  switch if it's 10% better- must be 100% better. Been pushing R internally,
  but it requires buy in.
  2. Make it easy: use Git, docker, etc. to allow for automated setup and
  publishing. Conveniently, this allows for reproducibility.
  3. Make it profitable: Spending less time on routine analysis allow sus to do
  more sophisticated work for our clients, bringing them more value, and use
  more profitability. Also, more experience. Much better to spend time
  training sophisticated ML models than with copying charts around in Excel.
