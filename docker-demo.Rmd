# Three stories.


## One.
1. New person comes and needs to run software. How do we do that?

## Two.

2. "Here's a script for speed parameter calculation! Oh. It doesn't work on
your computer?"

## Three

3. How do we deploy a Python application to a client's system if they don't
have python installed?

# Solution?

# Fiddle with your computer until it works!

# If only there was something better...

## Ideal solution would be:
1. Reproducible.
2. Fast.
3. Easy.

## What is Docker?
- Allows for the automatic deployment of "containers"
- Containers are lightweight VMs that wrap up code with everything needed to run
- "Write once run everywhere"
- Easy to write and use

# Demos!

## Benefits
1. Super fast to make code changes.
2. Snapshot in time- doesn't update without being told.

## Problems

1. Access to SQL Server--- Hamachi doesn't play nice with Docker.
2. Can have long compile times (e.g. if installing `gcc` from scratch.)
3. Can be difficult to get code in (typically use `git clone` or `COPY`,
which is a Docker command that copies the code directly from your local
filesystem).
