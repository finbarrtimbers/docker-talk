<!--
As consultants, many of the projects that we work on are similar, with many
steps repeated verbatim across projects. Previously, our workflow was based
largely in Microsoft Office, with our analysis done manually in Excel, our
reports written in Word, and our presentations in Powerpoint. In 2015, we began
using R for much of our analysis, including making slide decks and reports in
RMarkdown. Our presentation discusses why we made the change, how we managed it,
and advice for other consulting firms looking to do the same.

- Darkhorse Analytics is an analytical consulting firm
- Solve operational research problems, economic problems
- Major focus on high quality visuals (lots o' Tufte)

- Not documented code 
- Non-performant code

- No documentation: you can create visuals without documenting them

## Solution
- Code! R

## Advantages:
- implicitly self-documenting
- live 

### Disadvantages:
- more complicated
- creates dependency structure (need packages, etc.)
- must know R to edit, can't fiddle around

## Technologies (before)
- Microsoft Office: Excel, Excel, Excel

## Pain points with Excel
- Not obvious how to replicate

## Pain points with Powerpoint
- No server
- Hard to modify

## Benefits

## Problems with R

- Not easy for data consumers to use (feature?)
- Requires configuration; Excel is a VM unto itself (except Mac Excel)
